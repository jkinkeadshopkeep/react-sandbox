Training sandbox for react - for mostly personal use.

**Tasks completed:**
* Examples of hooks E.G using useState to track when the form has been updated and updating its current state.
* Implemented tests where possible.
* Be able to submit a form and output JSON.
* Be able to clear form state and form via a clear button.
* Migrated a lot of the HTML to its own specific components (Trying to use Atomic design)

**Tasks pending:**
* ~~Migrate info box to its own component with unit tests.~~
* ~~Create content container component with unit tests.~~
* ~~Wrap form inside a content container.~~
* ~~Fix main and content background colors.~~
* Make sure content container does not exceed 960px wide and is centered on desktop.
* Index buttons need to be side by side.
* Need some SVG's for display in inputs.
* Add highlighting on active form input.

**Optional tasks/ideas:**
* Some fancy SCSS stuff using global styling such as mixins etc.
* Output JSON into a prettified output - new tab? new windows? pop-up?
